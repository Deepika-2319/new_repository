What is git ???
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code. 
It enables collaboration among developers, facilitates branching for isolated work, and allows easy merging of changes.
Git ensures code backup, offers performance, and enjoys strong community support. 
It simplifies software development and integrates with various platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

Why Git ??
1.	Collaboration: Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. 
        It enables seamless collaboration by managing and merging code changes made by different team members.
2.	Version Control: Git tracks changes made to files over time, providing a detailed history of modifications.
        This allows you to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and easily identify and fix issues.
3.	Branching and Merging: Git's branching feature allows developers to create separate branches 
                               to work on new features or fixes. 
                           Once ready, these branches can be merged back into the main codebase, ensuring a smooth and controlled development process.
4.	Backup and Recovery: Git provides a distributed architecture, meaning every developer has a full local copy of the repository.
        This redundancy serves as a backup, reducing the risk of data loss.
git hub is a web based platform, that provides hosting for git repositories and additional collaborative features.
The .gitignore file is used to specify intentionally untracked files or directories that git should ignore. 


why github ????
GitHub is preferred over other platforms for using Git due to its popularity, extensive community, collaboration features
like pull requests and issue tracking, seamless integration ecosystem, 
support for both public and private repositories, facilitation of community contributions and project discovery, 
built-in documentation features, and reliable infrastructure.

Sure! Let's consider a simple example of managing a household chore list using Jira:

1. Task Creation: The family decides to use Jira to manage household chores efficiently. They create Jira tickets for each chore they need to accomplish, such as "Washing dishes," "Vacuuming the living room," "Taking out the trash," etc.

2. Assignment and Progress: Each family member is assigned specific chores. For instance, John is responsible for "Washing dishes," Sarah is assigned "Vacuuming the living room," and Mike is responsible for "Taking out the trash."

3. Collaboration: If any family member needs help or has a question regarding their chore, they can add comments to the respective tickets, and other family members can respond and collaborate within Jira.

4. Status Updates: As family members start working on their chores, they update the status of the ticket accordingly. For instance, John updates his ticket to "In Progress" while washing dishes.

5. Completion and Validation: Once a chore is completed, the responsible family member updates the ticket to "Done." Others can check the status to see if a particular chore is completed before taking any further actions.

6. New Tasks and Prioritization: If someone notices an additional chore that needs to be done, they can quickly create a new ticket in Jira, set its priority, and assign it to the appropriate family member.

7. Visual Boards: The family can create a Kanban board in Jira, where each column represents a different status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). They can then move the tickets across these columns as they progress through the chores.

By using Jira for household chore management, the family benefits from a centralized system that helps them organize, track, and collaborate on their tasks efficiently. It ensures that everyone knows their responsibilities, reduces the chances of missed chores, and promotes teamwork within the household.








Jira is a popular issue and project tracking software developed by Atlassian. It is primarily used for agile project management and bug tracking but can be adapted for various other project management styles as well.

The main uses of Jira include:

1. Issue Tracking: Jira helps teams track and manage tasks, bugs, and issues throughout the project lifecycle. Each issue is represented as a ticket with relevant details, status, and assigned responsibilities.

2. Project Management: It allows teams to plan and organize tasks, set priorities, and allocate resources efficiently. Users can create workflows tailored to their specific processes.

3. Agile Methodologies: Jira supports agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban. It enables teams to manage sprints, backlog, and visual boards for better collaboration and visibility.

4. Customization: Jira is highly customizable, allowing teams to adapt it to their unique workflows and project requirements.

Example:

Let's consider a software development team using Jira for their project management:

1. Task Creation: A developer identifies a new feature to add to the software and creates a new Jira ticket for it. The ticket includes a clear description of the feature, priority, and any relevant attachments or links.

2. Assignment and Progress: The team lead assigns the ticket to a developer. As the developer works on the feature, they update the ticket's status, such as "In Progress" or "Code Review."

3. Collaboration: If the developer encounters a roadblock, they can mention it in the ticket and seek help from other team members or specialized teams.

4. Code Review: Once the feature implementation is complete, the ticket is moved to the "Code Review" status, and a designated reviewer provides feedback on the code changes.

5. Testing and Quality Assurance: After the code review, the ticket moves to the testing phase, where testers perform various tests to ensure the feature works as expected.

6. Deployment: Once the testing phase is successful, the ticket is moved to "Done" status, and the feature is deployed to the production environment.

Throughout this process, team members can add comments, log work hours, and collaborate within Jira to maintain transparency and keep everyone informed about the project's progress.



Using Jira involves several key steps to set up and manage your projects effectively. Here's a general guide on how to use Jira:

Here's a concise comparison of Scrum and Kanban in a table format:

| Aspect              | Scrum                   | Kanban                   |
|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Methodology         | Fixed-length sprints    | Continuous flow          |
| Roles               | Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team | No specific roles     |
| Work Planning       | Planned in sprints      | Pulled from backlog      |
| Work Prioritization | Prioritized backlog     | Continuous prioritization|
| Cadence             | Fixed sprint duration   | No fixed timebox         |
| Changes during Execution | Discouraged during the sprint | Can be made at any time  |
| Metrics             | Velocity, Burndown chart | Cycle time, Throughput   |

Remember that the choice between Scrum and Kanban depends on the project's nature, team dynamics, and preferences. Each framework offers its own advantages and can be adapted to suit various development scenarios.
