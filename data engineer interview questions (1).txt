1. What is your plan after joining this data engineer role?
A: it works by first understanding the data infrastructure setup of the company, and you would also talk about how it can be
   made better or further improvised in the coming days with furtherr iterations.

Data engineers are the fastest growing tech occupation in 2019.

Collect and analyze the data from various resources and formats is called data engineering.

Data engineers are responsible for designing, developing and maintaining the data platform which includes:
           1. Data Infrastructure
           2. Data Applications
           3. Data Warehouse
           4. Data Pipelines


2. What is data engineering?
A: Data engineering is the process of converting the raw entity of data into useful information.


3. What is data modeling?
A: It is the process of simplifying complex software designs by breaking them down into simple diagrams that are easy to understand


4. What are the features of Hadoop?       
A: 1. Free and simple to use.
   2. Highly scalable: a large amount of data is distributed across several devices in a cluster and processed in a parallel
   3. Data is replicated across multiple DataNodes: data availability even if one of your system fails.
   4. Extremely versaatile:  hadoop can be performed with structured, unstructured and semi-structured data
   5. Faster Data processing

5. what are four v's in big data?
A: Volume, variety, velocity and veracity

6. Briefly describe Star Schema?
A: A star schema in a data warehouse can have one fact table and a number of associated dimension tables in the centre,
   which is mainly used for big data analysis.


7. Briefly about snowflake schema?
A: It is a logical arangement of tables in a multidimensional database that corresponds to the shape of snowflake.

8. What is meant by COSHH?
A: It provides scheduling at both cluster and apllication levels to have a direct positive impact on job completion time.

9. Name the XML configuration files present in Hadoop?
A: Core-site, Mapred-site, Yarn-site, HDFS-site

10. What is the difference between Spark and Mapreduce?
A: Spark processes and stores data in memory for subsequent steps, whereas mapreduce processes data on disc.
   Spark is more better and faster than mapreduce
what spark is used for?
A: Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed processing system used for big data workloads. It utilizes in-memory caching, and optimized query execution for fast analytic queries against data of any size.  

what do you mean vy mapreduce?
A: Mapreduce is a programming paradigm that enables massive scalability across hundreds or thousands of servers in 
  hadoop cluster. As the processing component Mapreduce is the heart of Apache Hadoop.

what is the difference between spark and hadoop?
A: Hadoop is designed to handle batch processing efficiently. Spark is designed to handle real-time data efficiently.
   Hadoop is a high latency computing and can process data interactively.

11. What is the Replication factor?
A: The replication factor is the number of times each Data Block is replicated by the Hadoop framework.

12. How is data security ensured in Hadoop?
A: Secure the authentic channel, Use received stamp to request a service ticket, Authenticate the connection

13. In your opinion, what does a Data Engineer majorly do?
A:  1. Handling data inflow and pipeline processing.
    2. Maintaining data staging areas.
    3. Performing data cleaning.
    4. Ad hoc query construction operations.

14. What is the use of Hive in the Hadoop ecosystem?
A:  Hive is used to provide a user interface for managing all of Hadoop's stored data.
